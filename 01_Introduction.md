## Introduction

RPWR is a spin-off of another experience called RBWR. If you are new to both experiences it is advised that you first try RBWR as it is a more complete game with much more support from the community and generally easier to comprehend.
RPWR is a simulator of a small modular PWR nuclear power plant. Only the control room is implemented at this time. The general idea of RPWR is to provide you with a realistic experience, including all main components interacting together like in real life, but without getting too much into details of every single switch of a real power plant.
It is advised that you begin with the startup guide (gear icon on the right) on a fresh private server, preferably alone.
