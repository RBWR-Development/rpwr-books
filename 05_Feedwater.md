# Feedwater/SG panel

This panel is the main control panel for the secondary system. It consists of 2 steam generators and 4 pumps. Each steam generator has an auxiliary electrically driven feedwater pump and a steam driven feedwater pump. The main goal of this panel is to maintain proper water level in the steam generators by adjusting feedwater flow to them. Autocontrol is provided which can maintain a desired setpoint with a selected pump (electrical or steam driven).
Electrical pumps should be used during startup, emergencies and as a support for full power operations. During normal operations steam driven pumps should be used (if enough steam is provided).
There are 4 relief valves which allow dumping steam and pressure in emergencies. Also, the Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) is located on the panel. This valve isolates the system if not enough vacuum is available in the condenser (above 500 mbar).
Additional makeup and drain valves are provided for the hotwell and also a CST makeup pump.
