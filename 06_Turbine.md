# Turbine panel

The turbine panel consists of two main valves. The bypass valve and turbine valve. They can be used when MSIV is open. Bypass is used to move steam directly into the condenser bypassing the turbine, on the other hand the turbine valve directs steam into the turbine.
The turbine can be started when enough vacuum is available in the condenser (50-70mbar) and optimal pressure (around 7100 kPa) is available in the main steam line. An automatic run-up system is available which automatically controls both the bypass and turbine valves as well as allowing you to change the target RPM and run-up speed. Synchronization speed is 1500 RPM.
In order to synchronize the generator, the exciter should be enabled and adjusted to around 6600V. The turbine should be a little above 1500 RPM, with the synchroscope pointing top and slowly moving clockwise. At this moment the generator breaker should be closed. If synchronization was successful the auto pressure hold can be enabled which will keep desired pressure automatically.
