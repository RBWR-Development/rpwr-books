# Condenser

The condenser uses an external water source to cool down the steam and let it condense back into water, which gathers in the hotwell. The condenser has several devices:

- 2 CARs (Condenser Air Removal), which are electric pumps which initially lower condenser pressure to allow MSIV to be opened.
- 4 SJAE (Steam Jet Air Ejectors) which are used to eject uncondensable gasses from the condenser. Two of them should always be on when steam is available.
- 2 Circulation pumps that circulate external water to cool down the steam. The more steam inflow, the more flow is required. Autocontrol is provided to keep condenser vacuum at desired level (55mbar).
