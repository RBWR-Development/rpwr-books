# Basic Interactions

Assuming that you are operating the reactor manually you should consider the following interactions between systems:

# Changing reactor power

Raising reactor power will cause primary temperature to rise and will yield higher steam production. Lowering the reactor power will have a reverse effect.

# Changing primary flow

Raising primary cooling flow WILL NOT change the temperature in the primary. Instead, reactor will react with higher power to more or less maintain the temperature. Therefore:
- RCP flow can be treated as another means of changing the reactor power (along with rods and boric acid). More flow will cause more power and more steam production.
- In order to reduce primary temperature after cooling flow is raised, reactivity must be reduced with other reactor controls to stop the power raise.

# Changing steam demand

Opening the turbine valve more, will cause pressure to drop and reactor power to raise to meet a higher steam demand. Feedwater temperature after an initial drop will raise back again.
